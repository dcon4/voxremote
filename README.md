# VoxRemote

Voice-enabled Android client for [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) servers — an independent fork of OC Remote with speech input, spoken replies, and a persistent notification controller.

**This is an unofficial community project, not affiliated with the OpenCode team or the OC Remote project.**

## Why VoxRemote

- **Talk instead of type** — dictate messages with your voice and hear replies read aloud
- **Drive it from anywhere** — a persistent notification with Listen, Stop, Read reply, and Auto-read controls, compatible with RemoteFix headset-button mapping
- **Work from anywhere** — use OpenCode through a mobile-first native chat or a full interactive terminal
- **Stay connected** — manage, reorder, and reconnect multiple remote servers, or run OpenCode directly on-device through Termux
- **Keep projects organized** — search, favorite, categorize, reorder, share, export, and revisit sessions across servers
- **Use the complete workflow** — stream responses, inspect tool output and context usage, attach files, answer questions, approve permissions, and run session actions without falling back to a desktop
- **Make it yours** — choose from 15 locales, flexible themes including AMOLED, and detailed chat, connection, notification, image, and voice controls
- **Operate reliably** — keep cached server content available during disconnects, resume safely after reconnect, review detailed sync conflicts, limit diagnostic exports, and use cryptographically verified in-app updates

## Features

### Voice
- **Dictation** — mic button in the chat composer turns speech into text; dictated text lands in the input box, and sends immediately when "confirm before send" is off
- **Utterance stitching** — short pauses mid-sentence don't cut your message short; dictation keeps listening through a configurable pause window before finishing
- **Spoken replies** — finished assistant replies are read aloud automatically (toggle), plus a "Read reply" action any time
- **Listening cue** — optional "Listening" announcement before the microphone opens; any spoken reply is cut off when the mic opens (barge-in)
- **Voice controller notification** — persistent notification with Listen, Stop, Read reply, and Auto-read controls, driven by MediaStyle/MediaSession so RemoteFix headset buttons map to it (actions 0–3: Listen, Stop, Read reply, Auto-read)
- **Text-to-speech engine picker** — choose any installed engine (for example Ivona, Google, Samsung) instead of the platform default
- **Tunable timing** — listen window (15–180 s) and pause window (2–10 s) are adjustable in Settings → Voice

### Native UI
- **Full chat interface** — native Material 3 UI with GFM markdown, code blocks, task markers, strikethrough, scrollable tables, syntax highlighting, and copy actions
- **Message streaming** — real-time text streaming with auto-scroll
- **Smart scroll behavior** — manual scroll disables auto-scroll; automatically re-enables when scrolled to bottom
- **File mentions** — `@file` autocomplete with server-backed path search and quick insert
- **Workspace files** — browse project folders, preview highlighted text, Markdown, and images, and download files without leaving the chat
- **Attachment support** — send images, PDFs, text, source code, and configuration files from device storage
- **Android sharing** — share one or multiple supported files into an existing or new chat on a connected server
- **Tool outputs** — expandable tool-call cards with selectable monospace output
- **Image preview & save** — open sent, draft, and Markdown images in a fullscreen viewer with pinch zoom, pan, double-tap zoom, and device saving
- **Shell output copy** — bash output blocks support text selection and one-tap copy (command + output)
- **HTML error fallback modes** — switch long HTML error payloads between rendered page view and raw code view
- **Collapsible reasoning** — reasoning expands on demand, with optional auto-expand and turn dividers for multi-message responses
- **Slash commands** — `/new`, `/fork`, `/compact`, `/share`, `/rename`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/shell`
- **Message actions** — long-press user messages to revert with confirmation
- **Reliable delivery** — outgoing prompts stay visible with queued state while delayed server events and history are reconciled
- **Offline-aware screens** — preserve cached chat and server content in read-only mode, show disconnected or reconnecting status, and resume loading after reconnection
- **Retry control** — connection retry errors and countdowns stay visible while Stop remains available to abort the pending run
- **Interaction queue** — simultaneous permissions and questions stay ordered with position, retry, parent-chat routing, and permanent-approval confirmation

### Terminal Mode
- **Termux-like terminal mode** — full-screen terminal UI with dedicated extra keys and mobile-first interactions
- **Server-scoped terminal tabs** — tabs are shared across sessions for the same server and managed from a drawer
- **PTY over WebSocket** — low-latency interactive I/O for CLI/TUI apps
- **Reliable PTY resize** — rows/cols update with viewport changes and IME transitions
- **TUI rendering improvements** — better full-grid rendering behavior for terminal UIs
- **Terminal shortcuts** — Ctrl/Alt latching, volume-key virtual modifiers (Ctrl/Fn), and `Ctrl+Alt+V` paste
- **Selection toolbar paste** — terminal selection menu includes paste action integrated with terminal input
- **Mobile navigation and recovery** — inertial scrollback, pinch zoom, explicit connection states, reconnect for transient failures, and in-place restart for exited tabs
- **Terminal guidance and keys** — optional panel-opening guidance, repeating arrow keys, and server-controlled cursor visibility, blink, and shape

### Session Management  
- **Multi-session** — switch between sessions, view history
- **Project browser** — search sessions, optionally group them by project, and start chats from 5–50 configurable recent directories
- **Session organization** — favorite and reorder important sessions across servers, filter Favorites with reusable custom categories and 32 icon choices, and keep offline favorites visible until their server reconnects
- **Session actions** — create, reload, fork, compact, run a code review, share/unshare, rename, and delete via explicit menus
- **Terminal mode shortcut** — open the current session in terminal mode from the chat top bar
- **Fast history loading** — show the newest 10 messages first, preload the configured 25–200 message target in the background, and load older pages on demand
- **Large-session stability** — configurable response limits, disk-backed processing, cached message images, oversized-payload fallback, and smaller-page OOM recovery
- **Session export** — export full session as JSON file with streaming progress notification
- **Multi-select in sessions** — long-press to enter selection mode, select multiple sessions, and delete in one action
- **Draft persistence** — input text, image attachments, and @file mentions saved per session; survives navigation, app restart, and WebUI detours
- **Read-only subagents** — child-agent sessions expose their history and context without unsafe prompt or shell controls

### Model & Agent Selection
- **Model picker** — search providers and models, follow server ordering, select model variants, and manage model visibility without leaving chat
- **Agent selector** — tap to cycle through agents; each agent colored with its TUI theme color (blue, purple, green…)
- **Reliable agent mode persistence** — explicit Plan/Build choice is preserved correctly between UI state and sent commands
- **Provider icons** — 74 vector icons for AI providers shown in model picker and next to assistant responses
- **Token usage** — displays total tokens and cost in toolbar subtitle
- **Context window details** — color-coded usage indicator with input/output/reasoning/cache, session totals, remaining capacity, and cost
- **Compact layout** — horizontally scrollable toolbar prevents overflow on long translations

### Localization
- **15 locales** — English (source), Russian, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese (BR), Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified), Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, Polish
- **Localization workflow** — locale files are maintained with `lokit` during development
- **Settings** — language and theme selection in Settings screen

### Settings
- **Language** — 15 locales (system default, English, Russian, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese BR, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, Polish)
- **Reconnect mode** — aggressive (1–5s), normal (1–30s), or conservative (1–60s) backoff strategy
- **Background WakeLock** — optionally keep screen-off SSE delivery active continuously, or reconnect after device wake and network changes
- **Theme** — light, dark, or system default
- **Dynamic colors** — Material You dynamic color support (Android 12+)
- **AMOLED dark mode** — pure black surfaces with accent borders across chat bubbles, cards, menus, dialogs, and input blocks (works with both static and dynamic colors)
- **Chat font size** — small, medium, or large text in chat messages and code blocks
- **Code word wrap** — toggle horizontal scrolling vs. word wrap in code blocks and tool outputs
- **Compact messages** — reduce spacing between messages for denser layout
- **Auto-expand tool results** — show tool card contents expanded by default
- **History preload target** — configure how many recent messages to load per session after the newest 10 appear (25–200)
- **Recent directories** — choose how many projects appear in the quick new-session dialog (5–50, default 20)
- **Reasoning display** — optionally auto-expand reasoning and show dividers between messages in one response
- **Confirm before send** — optional confirmation dialog before sending messages
- **Haptic feedback** — optional direct vibration with configurable duration, amplitude, and an immediate test action
- **Keep screen on** — prevents sleep while the chat screen is open
- **Notifications** — toggle task completion notifications
- **Silent notifications** — suppress sound and vibration for task notifications
- **Image optimization controls** — tune max image side (keep original or 720–2560 px) and WebP quality for attachments
- **Diagnostics** — inspect privacy-sanitized logs by severity, choose the latest 100–1,000 messages to export, and copy, share, or clear them without ADB
- **Settings sync** — synchronize preferences, ordered remote servers, categories, assignments, Favorites, and hidden models through GitHub Gist, WebDAV, or an Android document provider; conflicts persist with grouped local/remote comparisons, appear in Settings, and can trigger a notification, while credentials and local runtime configuration remain device-specific
- **Secure in-app updates** — automatic daily discovery plus manual checks from About; GitHub Release APKs are downloaded in-app, verified by SHA-256, package/version, and signing certificate, then handed to Android's system installer

### Connection
- **Multi-server** — connect to multiple OpenCode servers simultaneously and long-press remote server cards to reorder them
- **Local runtime via Termux** — set up and run OpenCode directly on-device from the Home screen (setup/start/stop/sessions)
- **Local runtime launch options** — configure LAN binding (`0.0.0.0`), optional server username/password auth, background launch mode, auto-start (background-only), startup timeout, and proxy/`NO_PROXY` from the app
- **Provider OAuth flow** — browser OAuth, headless fallback handling, and provider-state refresh on resume
- **MCP management** — inspect configured MCP server status, connect or disconnect servers, retry failures, and launch OAuth authentication from per-server settings
- **SSE event stream** — real-time session status, permissions, questions
- **WebSocket transport** — used for terminal PTY streams
- **Auto-reconnect** — exponential backoff starting at 1s, with max delay based on reconnect mode (5s/30s/60s)
- **Connection-aware screens** — disconnected and reconnecting banners span chat, sessions, terminal, files, WebView, provider/model, and MCP screens, with cached content retained and network actions paused until reconnect
- **Background service** — foreground service keeps connections alive when app is minimized
